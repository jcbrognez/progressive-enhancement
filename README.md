## Sprint in htlm &amp; css

Page realized at the beginning of my learning at Becode.

The purpose is to reproduce the most closely posible a mockup page (aesthetic & layout) with html & css.

#### Etapes principales :

1) HTML structure
2) Layout of content with CSS (positioning and flexbox)
3) Adding links
4) First try of building a popup chat message (not functional)
